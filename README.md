# Object Detection using Tensorflow API
**Implemented the research paper of Single Shot Detection using TensorFlow**

ðŸ”¸ **Problem Statement** - Given images of the different cigarrette packets on different aisles across different grocery stores, you have to train an object detection neural network to perform object detection on cigarrette packets of different brands so that the number of cigarrette packets of different brands can be counted and hence their availability can be tracked across different grocery stores and therefore better decisions can be taken regarding the supply chain of different brands of cigarette packets so as to ensure their continuous availability to the customer.

ðŸ”¸ We are using the COCO dataset to train our pre-trained ResNet50 by using training it for few epochs. The trained weights are saved and we applied inferences on the images and the annotations of bounding box

# **Make sure you are training the model with GPU enabled, otherwise it will show error**
